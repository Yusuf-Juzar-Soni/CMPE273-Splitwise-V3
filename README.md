To gain a better understanding of the inner workings, tools and technologies used to develop a distributed full-stack application/product. 

## What it does
We have simulated various features present in the original web application like
* A new user would be able to sign up and will be redirected to his dashboard which shows a summary of his transactions (How much he owes, how much he is owed etc.)
* Existing users can log in and would be redirected to their respective dashboards.
*	Form based validations have been implemented to check proper inputs
*	The user can see a list of groups he is part of, he can also search within that list of groups if he wishes.
*	The left navbar also contains links to the recent activity page where the user can view a history of who has added bills into the group.
*	The same navbar also contains a link to the invite list page which displays a list of groups the user has been invited to. The user can accept the invitation, only  after accepting the invitation will the group be visible in the users group list.
*	The members list also changes based on the invite status.
*	A member can create a group by selecting all the users registered in the app.
*	A member can settle up the amount he is owed and the amount he owes.
*	A basic profile page is visible that gets the data from the database and displays the data stored in the backend.


## How it was built
*	ReactJS makes call to backend through Apollo Client.
*	NodeJS receives the requests and performs MySQL queries to update the database.
*	Session is assigned to a user when he signs up or logs in.
*	MySQL database receives the requests from NodeJS and performs the operations to its tables.
*	Backend Sends the response back to React JS to display.
*	GraphQL was used instead of traditional REST API
*	Used React Testing Library to write frontend tests and Mocha to write backend tests to see if system functions as expected.
*	Deployed the application on AWS EC2 instances to leverage easy scalability the cloud platform has to offer.

## Tools used 
 ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS,MySQL, HTML5, React Bootstrap,GraohQL etc.

## Prerequisites
Before running this locally you must have Node, Express,MySQL, etc.setup. 
Clone the repository to your machine.
* Go into the Backend folder and run command npm install
* After installation completes run command node server.js
* Connection message and listening on port message will be displayed on successful start

* Go to the Frontend folder and run command npm install
* After installation completes run command npm start
* Go to url http://localhost:3000 to view App

## Challenges I  ran into
* Syntax for GraphQL tooksome timeto get used to.
